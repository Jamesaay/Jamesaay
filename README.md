### Who am I

I'm a technologist from Ireland. With 5 years in the insurance software implementation industry using a wide variety of technology including Java, Gosu, REST and AWS. Recently started as a Technical Support Developer where I handle requests from customer support when it requires more attention like looking through logs, database records, code checks etc. A forward thinking individual who craves for new knowledge each day and a great team-worker who keeps the mood in the team high while always having the end goal in mind. I aim to branch out from the insuramnce area to tackle more diverse and fulfilling projects within the other areas like finance, mobile development and games.
